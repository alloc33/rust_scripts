/*
WHICH PATTERN TO USE?

SIMPLE WORKER POOL (Arc<Mutex<Receiver>>):
✅ Quick and dirty
✅ Few workers (< 10)
✅ Short-lived tasks
❌ Mutex contention with many workers

THREAD POOL (Generic Job):
✅ Reusable
✅ Accepts any closure
✅ Production-ready
✅ This is what threadpool crate does

BOUNDED WORKER POOL (sync_channel):
✅ Prevents memory exhaustion
✅ Natural backpressure
✅ Producer can't overwhelm workers
✅ USE THIS for untrusted input!

REAL-WORLD USAGE:

// HTTP server with worker pool
let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);
for stream in listener.incoming() {
    let stream = stream.unwrap();
    pool.execute(|| handle_connection(stream));
}

// Task queue with backpressure
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::sync_channel(100);
for i in 0..10 {
    spawn_worker(rx.clone());
}
for task in untrusted_tasks {
    tx.send(task)?; // Blocks if queue full
}

WHY Arc<Mutex<Receiver>>?

Because Receiver is NOT Clone:
- Only one consumer can own it
- But we want multiple threads to consume
- Solution: Share with Arc, lock with Mutex

The mutex is FINE here because:
- Very short critical section (just recv())
- Unlikely to have contention
- Alternative (crossbeam) is overkill for small pools

NEXT STEP:

Combine this with your TCP server:
1. Accept connection
2. Send to worker pool via channel
3. Worker handles request
4. Response sent back to client

This is EXACTLY how production servers work!
